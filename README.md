# Connect-4-game

A digital version of the Connect-4 game. The project was collaborative, and we used colors and sound to make it graphically attractive. The project was made in the year 2017 and uploaded to github in 2019. This was our first collaborative project in any language and we really enjoyed making this. It provided us with a lot of insight in C++ and hope you guys enjoy this. Please use Turbo C++ to run this.
