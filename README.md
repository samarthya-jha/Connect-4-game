# Connect-4-game

A digital version of the Connect-4 game. The project was individual, and I used colors and sound to make it graphically attractive. The project was made in the year 2017 and uploaded to github in 2019. This was my first project in any language and I really enjoyed making this. It provided me with a lot of insight in C++ and hope you guys enjoy this. Please use Turbo C++ to run this.
